# Glang
A Golang-written stack-based language

# Development Stage
Right now the Glang code is hardcoded inside the Go source. You can edit the hardcoded Glang code.

# Quick Start
Clone this repo, then
```console
$ go build
$ ./glang
```

# Language Basics
Like [dq](https://github.com/kernelk14/dq) that i made, the syntax is the same.
